# __Credit Risk Classification Challenge (Module 20)__

## __Background__
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## __Instructions__
- The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## __Overview of the Analysis__
Analyze and identify the most suitable machine learning model for a peer-to-peer lending service to assess borrowers' creditworthiness based on loan risk.

Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., value_counts).
Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., LogisticRegression, or any other algorithms).
Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model 1:
Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the 1's, or predict the 0's? )
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
